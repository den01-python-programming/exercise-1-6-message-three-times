# Exercise 1.5 - Hi Ada Lovelace!

The exercise template comes with a program template that includes the function and its call.

```python
def hi_ada():
    name = "Ada Lovelace"
    # Write your code here
    
hi_ada()
```

Modify the program so that it prints the contents of the variable `name`, and the printed text is the following in its full form:

```plaintext
Hi Ada Lovelace!
```

**NB!** When using the `print` command, do not pass in the string "Ada Lovelace" as a parameter. Instead, use the existing variable `name`: `print("Hi " + ...)`
